## About

This repository is a simple, organic means of coordinating work on using Rust
and WebAssembly together.

## Get Involved!

Get involved with the Rust and WebAssembly community in just **three easy
steps!**

### 1. Join our Chat

Join the [Rust project's Discord server][rust-discord] and chat with the Rust and WebAssembly community in the `#wg-wasm` channel.

Say "hello" and introduce yourself!

### 2. Do some Rust and WebAssembly Yourself

Read our short [Rust and WebAssembly book][book], complete its [tutorial][], and
compile some Rust into WebAssembly. If you run into a paper cut or roadblock,
[let us know by filing an issue!][file-issue-book]

### 3. Join the Rust and WebAssembly Working Group

We meet on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) every other week to track progress, give status
updates, and discuss issues. We coordinate meetings with [issues labeled
"meeting" in the `rustwasm/team` repository][meetings].

First, get your feet wet by tackling one of these issues:

* [Issues labeled "good first issue" in the `rustwasm/*` repositories][good-first-issue]

* [Issues labeled "help wanted" in the `rustwasm/*` repositories.][help-wanted]

Next, take a look at [our 2019 roadmap][roadmap] to get a grasp on our goals for
the year, and see where you might be able to lend a hand. Unsure how to help
with a project or who to reach out to for a specific project? Ask in [our
chat][wasm-discord] and someone will point you in the right direction :)

Finally, if you've gotten this far, see [`GOVERNANCE.md#membership`][membership]
for information on becoming an official member of the working group!
